title: The Question Game
intro: The Question Game is an experiment in going a little deeper. It takes a set of 28 questions, designed to move you and your question partner beyond small talk, and presents them to you over 28 days. If you give it time, commitment, and courage, it will give you a more genuine connection.
author: Sean WC
questions:
  - Pick a person who knows you well. How might they describe you?
  - Consider the person you chose in the last question. What is something you admire about them?
  - Describe in your own words who you think your question partner is.
  - What is something about yourself that you would like your question partner to know?
  - What is it that made you want to play the question game with your question partner?
  - What is your favorite thing about where you live?
  - What was your favourite moment in the last few days?
  - What was the saddest moment of your life?
  - Share your recollection of your greatest achievement. What made it so meaningful?
  - Who was the most important person for you, outside of your immediate family, growing up?
  - What's one thing in your upbringing for which you're grateful?
  - If you could go back in time, what is one piece of advice you would give your younger self?
  - Have you ever had your heart broken? Share the story.
  - What is the first significant thing you bought with your own money?
  - What is the worst job you've had?
  - If you could travel to any time in history, to what time would you travel and why?
  - Do you believe in a higher power? How does this influence the way you live?
  - If you could steal one thing, without consequence, what would it be?
  - What is your reason for living? What gets you out of bed in the morning?
  - Have you ever had an experience you couldn't explain? Share it with your partner (try to refrain from seeking to explain your partner's experience unless invited to do so).
  - Is there a conspiracy theory or other 'outlandish' idea you consider credible? Why?
  - If you could choose, right now, one thing to achieve in your life, what would it be and why?
  - What steps could you take over the next month to increase your chances of bringing that goal into reality? Talk with your partner about how they might support you in this.
  - What is one relationship in your life you would like to improve? How would you like it to change?
  - For what would you like to be remembered?
  - What do you most value being able to give to others?
  - What is the one thing you have most enjoyed learning about your questions partner? What is the one thing you have most enjoyed sharing?
  - Who else might you like to answer these questions with? Why?

# Why?

As the clocks ticked past midnight on the first of January this year, few of us could have forseen that our collective reality would be so rapidly and unceremoniously upended. The steady rhythm of daily life has been replaced by something chaotic and uncertain. Kids are out of school, adults are out of work, and all of us are now confronted with the fragility of the world on which we depend.

Though none of us seem able to say exactly how, it seems clear that something important has changed. Our complex systems of governance, economics, defense have been shown to be vulnerable. The cracks in the dike are showing, and they may one day cause it to fail.

So the question, then, if we do not have the safety that centuries of long work has sought to bring us, is 'what do we have?'. The answer, as ever, is 'each other'. And so it seems there may be few better ways to spend some of the productive energy liberated by this pandemic than by building better connection with one another.

# What?

A Question of Connection is an experiment in using decentralised tech to build real-world connection between people. That's a little jargon-ey, but basically what it means is that we've built a tool that you can take and do whatever with - change it, extend it, break it. We don't want to determine how you use this thing. We've made it for you, and we just hope that you like it and get some value from using it.

A little more concretely, it's kind of like a tool where you can put in your own details and generate your own app, which you can then share with your friends. In the case of A Question of Connection, you can then use that app to guide you through a set of questions designed to foster closeness, shared understanding, and connection between participants. And of course you can also tweak or change the questions however you like!

# How it works

Find a friend, partner, lover, family member, co-worker, flatmate, or anyone you just want to be closer with. See if they would like to invest a little time and energy in getting to know you better. If it's a yes then follow the steps set out on the home page to get started.

There is no 'right way' to play The Question Game. You might decide to share your answers via text (perhaps in a messenger/WhatsApp/Telegram group so you can keep them separate from your regular chat), or on a phone or video call so you can hear and see one another while sharing. It's up to you and your Question Game partner.

The most important thing is that you are both committed to following through. We recommend that you agree up front how much time you want to commit to this each day (5 mins, 10 mins, 20 mins, 2 hours?) and then stick to that as best you can. It may also be helpful if you can agree a time you will keep free so you can both be present with one another's answers.

# The Rules

Rule #1:
There are no rules, only suggestions.

Suggestion #1:
There are no wrong answers. Share what feels true for you.

Suggestion #2
If you start then see it through. Let's be intentional about this.

Suggestion #3
Life's too short to be comfortable. Try to be a little more vulnerable than you ordinarily would.

Suggestion #4
Be gentle and listen deeply. You are being given a gift of vulnerability, and that is something worth honouring.

## Important points to note

This app is a little bit different. It doesn't rely on centralised servers to process your data. This means that we can't see what you're doing or saying, but it also means that we can't sync your question sets between you and your partner. So please note:

- Only the device you start on will know where you're up to. This means that you'll need to start a new 'instance' (by clicking 'add a person' again) and skip up to your current point on any new device.
- Your partner and you need to add each other on your version of the app on the same day in order to have the same question appear at the same time.

We've built this thing so that people can set it up with their own questions and put it out into the world. If you would like to run your own version of 'The Question Game' (or whatever you might like to call it!) then feel free to get in touch with us at...
